# Maze Game using React.js

This project is a maze game built using React.js. It utilizes a backtracking algorithm to generate the maze and depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find the end of the maze. Additionally, it leverages `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for managing state and side effects respectively, and incorporates Tailwind CSS for styling.
